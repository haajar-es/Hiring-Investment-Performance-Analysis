# Data Quality Management

In the process of developing and maintaining this Financial Analytics Dashboard, we encountered and addressed several data quality issues. This document outlines our approach to ensuring data integrity and the specific challenges we faced.

## Data Quality Assurance Process

1. **Initial Data Assessment**
   - Perform basic statistical analysis (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation)
   - Check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers
   - Verify data types and formats

2. **Regular Data Audits**
   - Conduct weekly automated checks using Power Query
   - Perform monthly manual reviews of key metrics

3. **Issue Logging and Tracking**
   - Maintain an issue log with details on each data quality problem
   - Prioritize issues based on impact and complexity

4. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Report significant data quality issues to data owners and relevant stakeholders
   - Collaborate on resolution strategies

## Common Data Quality Issues and Resolutions

### 1. Missing Values in Hiring Data

**Issue:** Approximately 5% of records in the hiring dataset had missing values for 'Hire Date'.

**Resolution:**
- Implemented a Power Query step to flag records with missing 'Hire Date'
- Collaborated with HR to fill in missing data where possible
- For irretrievable dates, used the first day of the hiring month as a proxy
- Added a calculated column 'Date Estimated' (Yes/No) to maintain transparency

### 2. Duplicate Employee Records

**Issue:** Found approximately 2% duplicate employee records, primarily due to system migration.

**Resolution:**
- Created a Power Query function to identify and flag potential duplicates based on Name, Employee ID, and Department
- Manually reviewed flagged records with HR
- Implemented a removal process for confirmed duplicates, retaining the most recent record
- Added a data validation step in the source system to prevent future duplicates

### 3. Inconsistent Department Names

**Issue:** Variations in department names (e.g., "Finance", "finance", "Finance Dept") causing inaccurate aggregations.

**Resolution:**
- Developed a standardization mapping table in collaboration with department heads
- Implemented a Power Query step to standardize department names
- Created a maintenance process for regular updates to the mapping table


## Ongoing Data Quality Improvement

- Conduct quarterly data quality reviews with stakeholders
- Maintain a feedback loop with data entry teams to address recurring issues
- Continuously refine data validation rules in source systems
- Provide regular training to data owners on data quality best practices

## Impact Measurement

We track the following metrics to measure the impact of our data quality initiatives:
- Percentage of records with missing critical fields (Target: <1%)
- Number of identified duplicates per month (Target: 0)
- Accuracy of department aggregations (Target: 100%)
- Number of manual data corrections required per month (Target: <10)

By implementing these data quality management practices, we have significantly improved the reliability and accuracy of our Financial Analytics Dashboard, leading to more informed decision-making across the organization.
